"{`Explore` | `Examine` | `Explain` | `Expose`} your model with the *explabox*!"**
</h3>

---

The `explabox` aims to support data scientists and machine learning (ML) engineers in explaining, testing and documenting AI/ML models, developed in-house or acquired externally. The `explabox` turns your **ingestibles** (AI/ML model and/or dataset) into **digestibles** (statistics, explanations or sensitivity insights)!

> figure: ingestibles to digestibles

The `explabox` can be used to:

- __Explore__: describe aspects of the model and data.
- __Examine__: calculate quantitative metrics on how the model performs
- __Explain__: use XAI methods for explaining the whole dataset (_global_), model behavior on the dataset (_global_), and specific predictions/decisions (_local_).
- __Expose__: see model sensitivity to random inputs (_robustness_), test model generalizability (_robustness_), and see the effect of adjustments of attributes in the inputs (e.g. swapping male pronouns for female pronouns; _fairness_), for the dataset as a whole (_global_) as well as for individual instances (_local_).

A number of experiments in the `explabox` can also be used to provide transparency and explanations to stakeholders, such as end-users or clients.

> :information_source: The `explabox` currently only supports natural language text as a modality. In the future, we intend to extend to other modalities.
